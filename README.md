## How To Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the command: 'npm run dev' in the terminal from the main directory.

Note: checkout won't work because I didn't publish my private Stripe key which I make use of in checkoutRoutes.js. You can open a Stripe account and get your own private key and use it. [(How to use Stripe)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r-F3FIONl8&t=1117s)
